IMMEDIATE CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED
1. REFRAME THE NOVELTY ANGLE
Current Problem: Standard combination of existing techniques
Solution: Focus on context-specific innovation
Specific Changes:

New Research Question: "How can hybrid logistic regression and rule-based filtering be optimized specifically for Filipino microfinance borrowers with limited credit history?"
Novel Contribution: Develop Philippine-specific risk factors and cultural financial behavior patterns
Add This Section: Create a "Cultural Financial Behavior Analysis" component that incorporates:

Remittance patterns from OFW families
Informal lending practices (paluwagan, 5-6 systems)
Agricultural seasonal income variations
Extended family financial obligations



2. STRENGTHEN METHODOLOGY IMMEDIATELY
Current Gaps: Vague research design, no baselines
Required Additions:
A. Comparative Framework (Add Chapter 2.12):
Baseline Models for Comparison:
1. Traditional FICO-style scoring
2. Pure logistic regression without rules
3. Pure rule-based system without ML
4. Current industry standard (from partner institution)
Performance Metrics: AUC-ROC, precision-recall, calibration plots
B. Proper Validation Strategy (Revise Section 2.9):
- 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test (not 70-30)
- Time-series split (older data for training, recent for testing)
- Cross-validation with stratification by income level
- Statistical significance testing (McNemar's test for model comparison)
C. Sample Size Justification (Add to Section 2.4):

Calculate required sample size for 80% power
Minimum 1,000 borrowers per risk category
Justify based on expected effect size

3. ADDRESS BIAS AND ETHICS COMPREHENSIVELY
Add New Chapter 2.13: Algorithmic Fairness Framework
Specific Requirements:
A. Bias Detection Protocol:
   - Test for disparate impact across gender, age, region
   - Implement demographic parity testing
   - Use equalized odds metrics

B. Fairness Constraints:
   - Set maximum acceptable bias thresholds
   - Implement fairness-aware model training
   - Document bias-accuracy trade-offs

C. Philippine-Specific Considerations:
   - Urban vs. rural lending bias
   - Regional economic disparities
   - Gender-based financial exclusion patterns
4. TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
A. Feature Engineering Enhancement (Revise Section 2.7):
Add Philippine-specific features:
python# New features to include:
- Remittance_stability_score
- Informal_credit_usage
- Seasonal_income_variation
- Extended_family_financial_burden
- Digital_payment_adoption_level
B. Rule-Based System Improvement:
Replace static rules with adaptive rule framework:
Dynamic Rules Based on:
- Economic cycle indicators
- Regional unemployment rates
- Seasonal agricultural patterns
- Inflation-adjusted income thresholds
C. Model Interpretability (Add Section 2.8):
Explainability Framework:
- SHAP values for feature importance
- LIME for individual predictions
- Rule contribution analysis
- Decision pathway visualization
5. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK OVERHAUL
Replace Section 2.9 with Comprehensive Evaluation:
A. Technical Metrics:
Primary: AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall AUC
Secondary: Calibration plots, Brier score
Fairness: Demographic parity, Equalized odds
Stability: Population stability index
B. Business Impact Metrics:
- Default rate improvement vs. baseline
- Loan approval rate changes by demographic
- Revenue impact assessment
- Risk-adjusted return calculation
C. Validation Protocol:
1. Historical backtesting (2-year period)
2. Walk-forward validation
3. Stress testing under economic scenarios
4. Bootstrap confidence intervals
6. LITERATURE REVIEW ENHANCEMENT
Add to Chapter 1.2:
Critical Missing Papers:

Fair lending regulations and algorithmic bias (Barocas & Selbst, 2016)
Credit scoring in developing countries (Schreiner, 2004)
Financial inclusion in Philippines (BSP Financial Inclusion Survey)
Explainable AI in finance (Arrieta et al., 2020)

Theoretical Framework Section:
1.2.5 Theoretical Foundation:
- Information asymmetry theory in lending
- Behavioral finance in developing markets
- Cultural economics and financial decision-making
- Regulatory theory for algorithmic systems
7. DATA COLLECTION SPECIFICITY
Replace Section 2.8 with:
Concrete Data Sources:
Primary Data:
- Partner Institution: [Name specific MFI]
- Sample Size: 2,000 borrowers minimum
- Time Period: 2021-2024
- Geographic Coverage: NCR, Region IV-A, specific provinces

Secondary Data:
- BSP Financial Inclusion Survey data
- PSA income and employment statistics
- Regional economic indicators
Data Quality Assurance:
- Missing data analysis and imputation strategy
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Data validation protocols
- Privacy protection measures (specific to RA 10173)
8. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
Add Chapter 2.14: Implementation Strategy:
Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Data collection and preprocessing
Phase 2 (Months 3-4): Model development and training
Phase 3 (Months 5-6): Validation and bias testing
Phase 4 (Months 7-8): Comparative analysis and documentation
9. EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND LIMITATIONS
Revise Section 1.5 to be more specific:
Measurable Outcomes:
- 5-10% improvement in AUC-ROC over baseline
- Reduced bias metrics below 0.1 threshold
- 95% confidence intervals for all performance metrics
- Detailed fairness audit report
Acknowledged Limitations:
- Single-institution data limitation
- Limited economic cycle coverage
- Generalizability constraints
- Regulatory approval requirements
10. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK
Add Section 2.15: Regulatory Alignment:
BSP Compliance:
- Manual of Regulations for Banks
- Fair lending practices
- Data privacy requirements

Documentation Requirements:
- Model validation documentation
- Bias testing reports
- Performance monitoring protocols
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

Secure Real Industry Partner: Get signed agreement with specific MFI
Define Measurable Success Criteria: Set specific performance targets
Implement Proper Statistical Testing: Use appropriate significance tests
Address Bias Systematically: Cannot ignore this for any financial ML system
Focus on Philippine Context: This is your main differentiator

TIMELINE FOR IMPROVEMENTS
Week 1-2: Rewrite methodology chapter with comparative framework
Week 3-4: Develop bias testing and fairness protocols
Week 5-6: Enhance literature review with theoretical foundation
Week 7-8: Finalize data collection agreements and protocols
BOTTOM LINE
Your thesis can be salvaged, but it requires fundamental methodological improvements and explicit bias mitigation strategies. The current version would not pass undergraduate defense at any reputable institution. However, with these specific changes, you can create a solid undergraduate thesis that contributes meaningfully to Philippine fintech research.
Most Critical Change: Transform from "let's combine two techniques" to "let's optimize credit scoring for the specific challenges of Philippine microfinance through culturally-aware algorithmic design with comprehensive fairness safeguards."
This reframing maintains your title while creating genuine academic value and practical impact.
