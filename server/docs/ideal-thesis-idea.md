# THESIS FRAMEWORK: "Improving Credit Scoring and Loan Recommendations with Hybrid Logistic Regression and Rule-Based Filtering for Filipino Microfinance"

## REFRAMED NOVELTY PROPOSITION

### Core Innovation: Integrated Cultural Context Credit Assessment and Loan Recommendation Pipeline
**Novel Contribution:** Development of culturally-informed feature weighting and penalty adjustments in hybrid logistic regression models combined with an intelligent loan recommendation system that specifically accounts for Filipino financial behavior patterns, moving beyond standard demographic-agnostic credit scoring to complete lending solutions.

### Primary Research Question
"How can cultural context variables be systematically integrated into hybrid logistic regression, rule-based filtering, and loan recommendation systems to improve credit risk assessment accuracy, fairness, and product matching for Filipino microfinance borrowers?"

## THEORETICAL FOUNDATION

### 1. Cultural-Context Credit Scoring Theory Framework
**New Theoretical Construct:** Culturally-Weighted Hybrid Scoring with Intelligent Recommendations
- Traditional hybrid: Logistic Regression + Rule-Based Filtering
- Cultural hybrid: Culturally-Weighted LR + Context-Aware Rules + Cultural Loan Matching
- Cultural weights derived from established Filipino financial behavior literature

### 2. Philippine-Specific Cultural Context Variables

#### High-Impact Cultural Factors:
- **Remittance Dependency Index**: OFW family income stability patterns
- **Extended Family Financial Network Score**: Household financial support systems
- **Community Social Capital Indicator**: Bayanihan cooperation and mutual aid participation
- **Informal Credit History Proxy**: Traditional lending participation (paluwagan, rotating credit)

#### Enhanced Economic Factors:
- **Seasonal Income Variation Score**: Agricultural/fishing community income patterns
- **Disaster Resilience Capacity**: Geographic typhoon exposure and recovery patterns
- **Digital Financial Inclusion Level**: Mobile money and digital banking adoption
- **Regional Economic Stability Index**: Local economic development indicators

#### Traditional Credit Metrics (Culturally Adjusted):
- Income verification (adjusted for informal economy participation)
- Employment history (considering overseas work patterns)
- Debt-to-income ratios (accounting for extended family obligations)

- Loan recommendation acceptance and performance tracking

## TECHNICAL METHODOLOGY

### 1. Enhanced Hybrid Credit Scoring and Recommendation Model

```
Cultural-Hybrid Model Architecture:

1. Cultural Feature Engineering:
   X_cultural = X_standard × Cultural_Weight_Matrix

2. Culturally-Weighted Logistic Regression:
   log(p/(1-p)) = (X_cultural × β) + Cultural_Adjustment_Term

3. Context-Aware Rule-Based Filtering:
   Risk_Score = LR_Score × Rule_Cultural_Multiplier + Rule_Overrides

4. Cultural-Context Loan Recommendation Engine:
   Product_Match_Score = f(Risk_Score, Cultural_Profile, Regional_Context)
   Loan_Terms = optimize(Amount, Rate, Schedule | Cultural_Constraints)

5. Cultural Fairness Constraints:
   Subject to: Cultural_Bias_Metrics < Threshold_Values
```

### 2. Loan Recommendation System Architecture

**2.1 Cultural Product Matching Framework**
```
Recommendation Pipeline:
Input: Cultural_Context_Profile + Risk_Assessment
↓
Cultural Product Categorization:
- Agricultural/Seasonal Loans (for farmers/fishermen)
- Remittance-Backed Loans (for OFW families)
- Community-Guaranteed Microloans (bayanihan-style)
- Emergency/Disaster Loans (climate-resilient)
- Digital-First Loans (for tech-savvy borrowers)
↓
Risk-Term Optimization:
- Interest rate adjustment based on cultural risk factors
- Repayment schedule alignment with cultural income patterns
- Collateral alternatives using social capital scores
↓
Output: Ranked loan recommendations with culturally-optimized terms
```
