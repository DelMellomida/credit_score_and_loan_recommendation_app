AI Applications Identified

Penalized Logistic Regression - Core ML model for credit scoring and default probability prediction
Rule-Based AI Systems - Hybrid filtering combining ML predictions with business logic rules
Natural Language Processing (NLP) - OpenRouter API integration for generating human-readable explanations of ML decisions
Model Explainability AI - Coefficient analysis and feature importance extraction for transparent decision-making
Continuous Learning Systems - Automated model retraining pipeline using real-world feedback data
Conversational AI - Chatbot system for explaining credit decisions to users


Strict Panelist Evaluation
As a strict academic panelist, here's my critical assessment:
Strengths ‚úÖ

Practical Problem: Addresses real financial inclusion issues
Hybrid Approach: Combining ML with rule-based systems shows methodological sophistication
Explainability Focus: Critical for financial applications and regulatory compliance
Implementation Detail: Comprehensive technical architecture demonstrates feasibility

Critical Concerns ‚ùå
1. Limited Technical Novelty

Penalized logistic regression is decades-old technology
No novel algorithmic contributions
Rule-based filtering is standard industry practice
Question: What's the research contribution beyond good engineering?

2. Questionable Research Scope

Reads more like a software development project than academic research
Where's the hypothesis testing?
No comparative analysis with existing methods
Missing statistical validation methodology

3. Dataset Limitations

Single dataset (a_Dataset_CreditScoring.xlsx) - serious generalizability concerns
No mention of dataset size, demographics, or representativeness
How do you handle bias in training data?
Red flag: Insufficient data diversity for robust conclusions

4. Evaluation Methodology Gaps

No clear performance benchmarks
Missing fairness metrics (crucial for credit scoring)
How do you measure "improvement" claimed in the title?
No A/B testing or real-world validation plan

5. Regulatory and Ethical Blindness

Credit scoring is heavily regulated (Fair Credit Reporting Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act)
No discussion of algorithmic bias or fairness
Missing ethical considerations for financial AI
Major oversight: Regulatory compliance strategy absent

Fundamental Questions ü§î

What's the research question? Your title promises "improving" but improvement over what baseline?
Where's the novelty? Combining logistic regression with rules isn't new. What makes this contribution significant?
How do you validate "improvement"? Need rigorous experimental design with control groups.
Generalizability? Single dataset, single domain - how does this advance the field?

Recommendations for Strengthening

Reframe as Research: Define clear hypotheses about hybrid ML-rule systems
Comparative Study: Benchmark against existing commercial credit scoring models
Multiple Datasets: Validate across different demographics and markets
Fairness Analysis: Address algorithmic bias and regulatory compliance
Novel Contribution: Either improve the algorithms or provide new insights about hybrid systems

Verdict
Current state: Strong engineering project, weak thesis
Potential: Could be valuable with proper research framing and validation
This has the bones of good applied research but needs significant academic rigor to meet thesis standards. The technical execution looks solid, but the research contribution is unclear.
